# HTML SASS Exam

This README provides an overview of the HTML SASS exam.

## Introduction

The HTML SASS exam is designed to test your knowledge and skills in using SASS, a CSS pre-processor. SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets and is fully compatible with all versions of CSS. It's used to write more maintainable, easy to share, and less repetitive style sheets.

## Exam Content

The exam covers various aspects of SASS including:

1. **Variables**: SASS allows for the use of variables, which can store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet.
2. **Nesting**: SASS supports nesting your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML.
3. **Mixins**: These are a way of re-using whole chunks of CSS, properties or selectors.
4. **Inheritance**: With the help of `@extend`, SASS allows classes to share a set of properties with one another.
5. **Operators**: SASS supports standard math operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.

## Preparation

To prepare for the exam, you can use resources like the SASS tutorial on W3Schools and the SASS guide on the official SASS language website. These resources provide comprehensive learning materials, including examples and exercises to practice your skills.

## Conclusion

The HTML SASS exam is a great way to demonstrate your proficiency in using SASS to write more efficient and maintainable CSS. Good luck with your studies!
